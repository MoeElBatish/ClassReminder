# ClassReminder
This is a class Reminder application that sends you texts every morning informing the user where and when his classes will be that day.
There are 2 ways to use this Application.
1. Keep it running on a server such that the user will get the text at the preferred time.
2. Download Cron to use it to run the script every 24h.

Both versions will be added to this repository and it will be clear which one is which.
